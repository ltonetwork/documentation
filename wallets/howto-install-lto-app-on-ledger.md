A Ledger device is a hardware wallet. Hardware wallets are considered very secure for the storage of a user’s private keys in the blockchain. Your digital assets are safe even when used on an infected or untrusted computer.‌

Please note that this tutorial applies only to **Native LTO coins (LTO Mainnet)**. Do not try to send or receive tokens directly from Ethereum or Binance chains as your funds may be lost forever!‌

### Interface

The interface is exactly the same as described on the [Official Web UI](wallet-web-app.md) page. The only addition while using a Ledger device is that it requires to sign transactions by physically touching your Ledger device.

### Signing transactions

On-chain actions need to be signed with your keys, and will therefore need the Ledger to be connected.\
After you click Send, Lease, or any other action, it will prompt you to sign with the Ledger device.

In case you want to sign the transaction, acknowledge the signing process on your Ledger device with "accept and sign".
